This worK is devoted to the development of software for organizing a secure network tunnel through Telegram and VKontakte messengers without using external IP addresses. The main method of operation is the encapsulation of network traffic into messenger transport protocols using end-to-end encryption. The thesis analyzes existing virtual private network solutions and develops an algorithm for aggregating, compressing, and transmitting data via messenger APIs. A cryptographic protection system based on the Russian standard GOST R 34.12-2015 has been implemented. The details of the developed system are presented structurally in the form of block diagrams. A demonstration of the software tool is provided, which allows us to conclude that the software is applicable.
